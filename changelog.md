# Changelog — BB Project Master Template  
**Author:** Zack AhSam‑Kreiter

# Versioning Philosophy  
The BB Project uses **semantic versioning** to maintain clarity, auditability, and long‑term structural stability.

- **MAJOR (X.0.0)** — Introduces structural changes to the HTML schema, comparison engine, or export logic. These versions may break backward compatibility and require downstream updates.  
- **MINOR (0.X.0)** — Adds new sections, identifiers, or enhancements that do not break existing schema‑locked structures.  
- **PATCH (0.0.X)** — Fixes formatting, clarifies documentation, or resolves minor inconsistencies without altering the schema or workflow.  

All changes must flow through the protected `main` branch via the `dev` → `main` pull‑request workflow, ensuring zero drift and full traceability.

## 1.0.0 — Initial Commit (2026‑02‑17)  
- Added `master-template.html` as the authoritative single‑file HTML master template.  
- Added `README.md` with project overview, governance rules, and branching model.  
- Added `changelog.md` with initial version entry and versioning baseline.  
- Established repository structure, semantic versioning, and zero‑drift workflow foundation.  
- Added author information and formatting updates to `README.md`.  
- Verified branch protection and established the `dev` → `main` pull‑request workflow.  
- Integrated the **initial structural outline generated by NotebookLM**, imported into **MSCP**, and enhanced to align with schema‑locked identifiers and BB Project architectural standards.

## 0.9.x — Pre‑Release Development (2026‑02‑16)  
These entries document the conceptual and structural work completed before the repository reached version 1.0.0.

### 0.9.2 — Structural Refinement  
- Enhanced the initial NotebookLM‑generated outline to align with BB Project schema‑locking principles.  
- Added structural comments and section markers to support future comparison logic.

### 0.9.1 — MSCP Import & Alignment  
- Imported the early conceptual structure from **NotebookLM** into **MSCP** as the foundation for the authoritative template.  
- Began aligning identifiers, section boundaries, and export‑layer considerations.

### 0.9.0 — Initial Template Draft  
- Created the first draft of `master-template.html`.  
- Established schema‑locked identifiers and structural scaffolding for VA Blue Button reconstruction.

# NotebookLM Ingestion Note  
This repository is optimized for ingestion into **NotebookLM** to support:

- semantic indexing of the HTML template  
- cross‑referencing between schema‑locked identifiers  
- retrieval of governance rules and workflow constraints  
- multi‑file reasoning across Markdown and HTML  
- longitudinal tracking of template evolution  

NotebookLM should ingest:

- `README.md` — project overview and governance  
- `master-template.html` — authoritative schema‑locked structure  
- `changelog.md` — temporal anchors for version evolution  
- `governance.md` (when added) — ruleset and workflow constitution  
- `structure.md` (when added) — semantic map of the HTML template  

This ensures consistent, drift‑free reasoning across future enhancements.
