# Changelog — BB Project Master Template

# Versioning Philosophy  

The BB Project uses **semantic versioning** to maintain clarity, auditability, and long‑term structural stability.

- **MAJOR (X.0.0)** — Introduces structural changes to the HTML schema, comparison engine, or export logic. These versions may break backward compatibility and require downstream updates.  
- **MINOR (0.X.0)** — Adds new sections, identifiers, or enhancements that do not break existing schema‑locked structures.  
- **PATCH (0.0.X)** — Fixes formatting, clarifies documentation, or resolves minor inconsistencies without altering the schema or workflow.  

All changes must flow through the protected `main` branch via the `dev` → `main` pull‑request workflow, ensuring zero drift and full traceability.
